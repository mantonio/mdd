Actually I should say it took 16 years to find the courage to get out of what had been so comfortable. Retail was all I had done since I became old enough to work, but I knew it wasn’t what I wanted to do. I knew that I wanted to do something in the technology field dealing with computers, but just wasn’t sure what.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2010. I had enough with retail and began teaching myself web design and how to use a popular <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> known as Joomla. I loved it and began getting some work from a few small businesses in North Carolina. At the age of 33 I finally found what I wanted to do and went after it full steam ahead. I left retail at the end of 2010 and actually made it until late 2011 when I figured I needed some more education so I can be the best I can be.

<p>Fast forward to the present. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor’s Degree in Web Design &amp; Development at Full Sail University here in Orlando.</p>

<p>It’s an extremely fast paced program and certainly not easy, but I have learned a ton in a very short time. The Web program at Full Sail is the youngest, but considered one of the hardest programs offered. Needless to say, if you want to make it through Full Sail, you had better put 110&#37; into every class and be prepared to fail at times.</p>

<p>Time is flying by and it won’t be long before I’m back in the real world so when I have any extra time, I’m looking for any type of job no matter how small to boost my experience. If you landed on this site looking for someone local to help you with a current website or build a new one, then you came to the right place. I put in everything I can and am passionate about the web.</p>
